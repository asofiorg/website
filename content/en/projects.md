# Collaboration

We inspire and support STEM and innovation projects of girls and women for peace building and rural development.

## AgroSencore

Led by a group of only girls, AgroSencore is a startup that wants to use Artificial Intelligence to increase the profit of farmers with substitution crops, particularly cocoa, to provide them with a profitable and different option to illicit crops, while we accustom them to technological devices.
